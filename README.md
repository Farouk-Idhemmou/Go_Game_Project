Objective:
            Players aim to control more territory than their opponent by surrounding vacant points and capturing enemy stones.

Board: 
            The game is played on a grid board, traditionally 19x19 lines, though smaller sizes like 13x13 or 9x9 are also common.

Stones: 
            Two players, Black and White, take turns placing stones of their color on intersections of the lines.

Turns:     
            Players alternate turns, with Black playing the first stone.

Liberties:     
            Stones are captured when they have no liberties (empty adjacent points). A group of connected stones shares liberties.

Ko Rule: 
            To prevent infinite loops, a player cannot repeat the previous board position exactly.

Passing: 
            A player may choose to pass their turn if they believe there are no beneficial moves left.

Scoring: 
            After both players pass consecutively, stones inside captured territory are removed, and players receive points for surrounded territory and captured stones.

Endgame: 
            Players may play inside their own territory to reduce their opponent's potential points, known as endgame play.
